VERTEX MOBILE NET CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS
Final Project in the Only Quality Data Internship Program 

Project Brief
As telecommunications engineers, we hold vast amounts of technical knowledge and expertise, so that at the end of the day, our customers have a seamless experience when interacting with our services. Therefore, we must pay close attention to customer behavior to anticipate their likelihood of churning or continuing to use our services.

With a keen interest in telecom analytics, I embarked on a project to analyze a hypothetical customer dataset for Vertex Mobile Net, a telecom company based in the US offering services including Telephone Services, Internet Services, Data Services, Television Broadcasting, Wireless Communication, and Cloud Services.

Vertex Mobile Net has experienced a reduction in revenue over the past few months. In response, the manager initiated fundamental changes in customer retention strategies and business operations based on insights from their customer data. I was tasked with analyzing customer data to track the churn rate and aid in adjusting company policies to keep customers happy with the company’s telecom services.

Steps Followed:
•	Understanding the Data
•	Data Cleaning and Wrangling
•	Data Analysis
•	Dashboard Building
•	Uncovering Insights

Key Insights:
	California (CA) has the highest churn rate among the states analyzed.
	Churn rates decrease as the length of the customer account increases.
	Younger customers are less loyal and more likely to switch providers.
	Higher-spending customers are leaving, which could indicate dissatisfaction with perceived value.
	The main reasons for customer churn are competitor influence and dissatisfaction with customer support services.

Recommendations:
	Invest in advanced training for customer support representatives and implement a robust feedback system to identify and address customer pain points.
	Enhance loyalty programs and provide exclusive benefits to high-spending customers to improve their value perception.
	Implement automated solutions such as chatbots and AI-driven customer service to handle routine inquiries and reduce call volume.
	Develop engaging, tech-savvy marketing campaigns and loyalty programs tailored to younger demographics to boost their retention.
	Enhance competitive strategies and improve support services by benchmarking against competitors’ services and pricing.
By leveraging data analytics, we can make informed decisions to improve customer satisfaction and retention, ensuring that our customers have a positive and seamless experience with Vertex Mobile Net’s services.
